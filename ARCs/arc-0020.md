# Algorand Standard Asset Parameters Conventions for Soulbound NFTs

## Summary

This document introduces conventions for the parameters of Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) for soulbound non-fungible tokens (NFTs).


## Abstract

Soulbound tokens are a primitive in an emerging web3 trend where non-transferable, publicly-verifiable digital tokens can represent membership, credentials, and affiliations. Unlike pure NFTs, soulbound tokens are permanently linked to a wallet or account forever. Issuing addresses or receiving addresses are known as souls. The goal of these conventions is to make it simpler for developers to deploy soulbound NFTs on Algorand.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### ASA Parameters Conventions

The ASA parameters should follow the conventions for pure non-fungible tokens as described in [ARC-0003](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0003) except for the following parameters:

* *Manager Address* (`m`): **MUST** be set to issuing soul address to establish provenance.
* *Default Frozen* (`df`): **MUST** be _True_ to freeze holdings for the asset by default.
* *Freeze Address* (`f`): **MUST** be set to `""` or empty, to indicate that unfreezing is not permitted.

## Rationale

For a token to be described as Soulbound, it must be meet the following criteria:
1. Publicly verifiable
2. Non-fungible
3. Non-transferable

The Algorand blockchain provides the means for publicly verifiable transactions. The [ARC-0003](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0003) sets the conventions for creating non-fungible tokens. To make NFTs non-transferable, thereby becoming soulbound, the asset _Manager Address_, _Default Frozen_, and _Freeze Address_ parameters must be modified as specified above.
